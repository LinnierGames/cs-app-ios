### About this project
This app, this awesome app will keep our members up-to-date on new changes to their issues and make exploring new projects and top issues easy to boost productivity. This app will also help keep resources easy to access such as quick links and perhaps new posts to quickly inform members.
### The technologies
The tools will limit a lot of programmers; a Mac is needed. The project was created using Xcode and as far as I know there's isn't a windows replica. GitHub's API will be the core service of this app so understanding that will play a good chunch of the development.

>[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is the IDE, tool to upload to the AppStore, etc

>[GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/) [Guides](https://developer.github.com/guides/)

>[iPhone Development Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) if the club wanted to develop on actual iOS devices vs being limited on the simulator. We'd use [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/)
